# My CV 📄

This is my work in progress CV webpage. I chose Astro because I think this should be a) the ideal use case for it, and b) I want to.
If you happen to read this Readme. This might be work in progress

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3b71d2ba-25f4-4dbc-bfff-68389c239307/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/holgergp-cv/deploys)

I left the docs below in this repo for my own convenience:

## TODO

- [ ] Fill out all the CV pages
- [ ] Load data from astro DB
- [ ] Make CV printable 

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

The easiest way to run this project locally is to run the following command in your desired directory.

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create astro@latest --template satnaing/astro-paper

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create astro@latest -- --template satnaing/astro-paper

# yarn
yarn create astro --template satnaing/astro-paper
```

## Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) in AstroPaper using environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following env variable, the google-site-verification tag won't appear in the html `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-google-site-verification-value
```

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
